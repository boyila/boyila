# Hi there, I'm Trishika Boyila 👋

## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me
I’m a machine learning engineer passionate about building **AI‑driven products and autonomous agents** that solve real‑world problems. My work spans natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG), generative AI, computer vision and MLOps. I enjoy experimenting with state‑of‑the‑art architectures, optimizing ML pipelines and deploying robust applications to production. I’m currently exploring **multi‑agent systems and agentic AI** frameworks that enable LLMs to reason and act.

- ⚙️ **Core Skills:** Python, Jupyter, PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI APIs, FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, GCP/AWS
- 📚 **ML/NLP:** model fine‑tuning, embeddings, sequence‑to‑sequence models, reinforcement learning, attention mechanisms, prompt engineering, RAG pipelines
- 🚀 **Agentic AI:** orchestration frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI), memory stores, autonomous tools & assistants
- 💻 **MLOps:** CI/CD, cloud deployments, containerization, experiment tracking (MLflow), model serving
- 📊 **Data:** Pandas, SQL, NoSQL, data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), ETL pipelines
- 🌐 **Web:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, REST APIs, GraphQL
- 🧐 **Research & Projects:** medical imaging (tuberculosis detection via chest X‑ray), conversational bots, social automation, knowledge‑graph generators

I’m always eager to collaborate on cutting‑edge AI projects. When I’m not coding, I enjoy contributing to open‑source communities and mentoring other developers.

## 🔥 Projects
Here are some of my favorite projects (check the pinned repositories for more):

| Project | Description | Tech |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI Engineering Hub** | A curated collection of resources, templates and best practices for AI/ML projects – from data preprocessing to deployment. | Python, Jupyter, ML frameworks |
| **Bolt.new‑any‑LLM** | Template for full‑stack web apps powered by any LLM. It supports prompt engineering, function calls and plug‑in integration out of the box. | TypeScript, Next.js, LangChain |
| **Tuberculosis Detection** | Collaboration with Omdena’s Pune chapter to build an early‑detection model for tuberculosis from chest X‑ray images. | Python, PyTorch, CNNs |
| **ML Project** | General machine learning projects in Jupyter notebooks exploring supervised and unsupervised models. | Python, Jupyter, Scikit‑learn |

Feel free to explore other repositories for more bots and automation scripts. Each repo includes a README with setup instructions and technical details.
